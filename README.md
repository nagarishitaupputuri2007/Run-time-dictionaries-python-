Title: DataFrame Operations in Pandas: Concatenation, Description, Sorting, and Slicing

Description:
This project demonstrates essential runtime operations using Python's pandas library for DataFrame manipulation. It includes:

Creating multiple DataFrames (df1, df2, and df3)

Concatenating them into a single DataFrame using pd.concat()

Instructions for running statistical summaries on individual columns using .describe()

Sorting DataFrame values based on specific columns

Slicing DataFrames to view selected columns

These operations are fundamental for data preprocessing and exploration in data analysis workflows.
